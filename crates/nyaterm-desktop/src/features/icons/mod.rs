//! Icon lookup tables.
//!
//! This is the data half of the icon system; the element half lives in
//! [`crate::features::view_widgets::icons`]. Keeping them apart is what stops a
//! ~1000-line brand table from being rebuilt inside a render closure.
//!
//! The tables are a port of the pre-GPUI `src/components/icons.tsx`. Their keys
//! are **persisted user data** — `SavedConnection::icon` and
//! `QuickCommand::icon_tag` are free-form strings written by both the old and the
//! new app and carried in `.nya` backups — so keys may be added but never
//! repurposed or removed.
